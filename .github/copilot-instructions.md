<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a modern web application for testing and visualizing Schouten's formulas for prime number calculations. The application implements advanced mathematical algorithms for deterministic prime generation and analysis.

## Key Mathematical Concepts
- **Schouten's Deterministic Formulas**: Implementation of next_prime(), prime counting Ï€(k), and gap calculations
- **Conical Prime Spiral**: 3D geometric representation of primes using logarithmic coordinates
- **Primorial and Modular Filtering**: Advanced prime sieving techniques
- **Real-time Mathematical Computations**: Interactive calculators for all formulas

## Technical Stack
- **Vite + Vanilla JavaScript**: Fast development and performance
- **Three.js**: 3D visualization for the Conical Prime Spiral
- **Modern CSS**: Responsive design with mathematical notation support
- **Web Workers**: For heavy computational tasks (if needed)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear, mathematical variable names that match the formulas
- Comment mathematical algorithms with formula references
- Implement efficient prime number algorithms
- Maintain separation between mathematical logic and UI components
- Ensure all calculations are accurate and well-tested

## Mathematical Accuracy
- All implementations must match the exact Schouten formulas provided
- Validate results against known prime sequences
- Handle edge cases and large numbers appropriately
- Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
