- Generate primes without traditional primality testing

### B. Prime Counting & Inverse Functions
- **Prime Counting Function**: `œÄ(k) = k - 1 - C(k)`
- **Inverse Prime Counting**: Find the nth prime directly
- Exact prime counts without sieves

### C. Primorial & Modular Filtering
- **Primorial Calculation**: `p# = ‚àèp_i`
- **Survivor Criterion**: Advanced prime filtering using modular arithmetic
